# **WIPER SYSTEM**

## ABSTRACT:

Windshield wipers are a small part of your car, but they have a big impact on your driving and overall safety. They remove rain, snow, dirt, pollen, frost and other debris quickly and smoothly at the push of a button.The windshield wiper motor moves the windshield wiper arms across the windshield. The metal or hard plastic arms drag a thin rubber (or silicone) blade across the windshield to clear away water, giving you a better view of the road.Over time, windshield wiper blades crack, tear and lose their flexibility and functionality. Everything from road grit to bird droppings to extreme temperatures to ultraviolet rays contributes to wipersâ€™ breakdown.
