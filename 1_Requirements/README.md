# **WIPER SYSTEM**

## INTRODUCTION:

Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.

The wipers combine two mechanical technologies to perform their task:
    
* A combination electric motor and worm gear reduction provides power to the wipers.
    
* A neat linkage converts the rotational output of the motor into the back-and-forth motion of the wipers.
    
    
## COMPONENTS:

* STM32 Microcontroller.

* STM32 CUBEIDE.


## INTODUCTION TO STM32 MICROCONTROLLER:

The STM32 family of 32-bit microcontrollers based on the Arm® Cortex®-M processor is designed to offer new degrees of freedom to MCU users.It offers products combining very high performance, real-time capabilities, digital signal processing, low-power / low-voltage operation, and connectivity, while maintaining full integration and ease of development.

The unparalleled range of STM32 microcontrollers, based on an industry-standard core, comes with a vast choice of tools and software to support project development, making this family of products ideal for both small projects and end-to-end platforms.STM32 microcontrollers offer a large number of serial and parallel communication peripherals which can be interfaced with all kinds of electronic components including sensors, displays, cameras, motors, etc. All STM32 variants come with internal Flash memory and RAM.
